So I'm trying to raid together 2x 256gb SSD's I'm trying to put into raid 0 together as a non boot drive. I don't need the redundancy as this is purely intended to be a performance drive for games. I have followed the instructions in my manual and as you can see in the images at step 2 it says hit peripherals/Intel rapid storage technology sub menu. As you can see this option does not exist. Anyone know why this is not available? All other options prior to this have been correctly.

Windows 8.1 and a Lenovo G40-70: when I attempt to download IRST from Lenovo website, Intel's utility installer warns be about NET Framework 4.5 not being installed, but I have version 4.72 installed!

I've been stuck with this problem for a day and I can't seem to find its solution. Let me give you a bit of background so you can better understand the problem. I had an old SSD (120GB) with my OS on it and a secondary HDD for storage. Recently, I acquired a new SSD (500GB), along with a new Processor and a new Mobo, so far all good. Performed a clean install of Windows 10 in my newest SSD, and in the select disk screen I deleted all of my partitions The ASUS H81M-K motherboard features the Intel® H81 chipset, designed for everyday productivity. It has a friendly UEFI BIOS, GPU Boost for overclocking integrated graphics and USB 3.0 Boost – an exclusive technology that makes data transfers faster So I'm not the most advanced PC user but I do have some questions about general computers I would love answers to. 1. What is the difference if any in performance between different types of cables like HDMI, DVI, DisplayPort, and VGA? Any to avoid? 2. If you're using multiple monitors, do you want to plug both cables into your GPU, or one in the GPU and one into the motherboard? Assume that the first one is being used for gaming and the second one is general office use. 3. some compute.

Last time I posted here about 4 days ago I was told my RAM wasn't on my motherboard's QVL, so I should drop the memory speed to 2133MHz from 3200MHz, which I did. Today I've blue screened three times, all with different stop codes. Once while playing Apex Legends 
I boot off of a 480 GB M.2 NVMe drive, and use a 1 TB Samsung Evo 860. Do I need to enable it in my BIOS or not? Also, I read a lot about this AHCI. also that sometimes it’s default enabled? Is this something I need to look into? And to finalize, is there ANYTHING I should enable, disable, or change in my BIOS? I’ve already installed windows, but am willing to reinstall if needed. No issues there. Use case: I have an extra 120Gb M.2 SATA SSD lying around from upgrading the storage in my laptop and I have a 3 TB spinning platter drive in my desktop. M.2 to SATA adapters are pretty damn cheap (about ). I was wondering how feasible it would be to use this extra SSD as a read cache for my spinning platter drive. Relevent specs: Proc: i7-4790k MoBo: ASUS z97 Sabertooth Mark 1/USB 3.1 So it really comes down to if it is possible to get RST working in this scenario? Lately by T450s has started booting VERY slowly and I get the 2102 Detection error and have to hit escape every time I boot. Every solution I found online involves re-seating the SSD. I opened up my laptop and realized that I don't even have one. The slot is empty. Any idea why my bios has started looking for an SSD2 and how to tell it to stop? Thanks. Edit Problem solved: see comments. Hello, I'm running Win10 on a Dell desktop. Lately I've started getting a driver\_power\_state\_failure BSOD at every startup, and the usual solutions on Google haven't helped. I've tweaked the power settings, updated and replaced all my drivers, and done virus scans that turned up nothing. I installed WhoCrashed and it gave me these error messages: https://imgur.com/a/q3UTQuR (https://imgur.com/a/q3UTQuR) Can someone tell me what this means Every time my HP laptop boots I get some lines about Intel RAID and if I press Ctrl+I I get to this screen https://i.imgur.com/4msypBq.jpg It looks like there’s a disabled drive or even SSD. Am I making a correct assumption there? I can’t enable it if there is one. Strange. 
After opening the app it automatically configured a raid between the HDD and the SSD. I thought that a clean installation of windows would clear the raid but it didn't, and it only shows one drive with 500gb when in reality the computer has an 240gb SSD and a 1tb HDD. How do I fix this and delete Installed a new Samsung 860 EVO ssd last night. Used the Samsung Data Migration tool to clone my HDD. Booted up today and got a warning from Intel Rapid Storage. “PCIe SSD on controller 3, Port 0: offline” Can not find a resolution to the warning. It doesn’t seem to be affecting the system and looks like it is coming from a smaller partitioned part of the drive contains the system restore files. Did I need to change anything in the BIOS when I installed Hey everyone, So how screwed am I with this client's system? There are 5x 2TB Drives installed, and the RAID 5 (Parity) shows as rebuild for status, with the size of the RAID being identical to only a single hard disk. Picture: https://imgur.com/a/c5GWkDN I've never had to repair RST RAID's before as I usually tend to use LSI cards so have no experience here. The story is that Windows now does not boot and simply does an automatic repair loop. I'm able to use drvload and load the driver. OS: Windows 10 upgraded from win8 installed net framework up to 4.7.2 relevant hardware: 500GB regular drive with 24GB cache memory drive I did a fresh install and am in the midst of installing drivers. I remember setup of these to be a major pain in the ass, but I realize I have three (as in the title) - expresscache, intel rapid storage and intel rapid start. From what I can tell, they all try to do the same thing - use a small solid state memory (~24GB in my case) to augment the speed. sounds noob , but actually i cant install intel optane , error shoews up telling me that i cant have both intel rapid storage and intel optane at the same time ! i dont know whitch one is better and why ?! i have samsung ssd as a system drive , i7 8700k cpu , 16gb ram i use it for gaming most of the tmes and watching 4k movies can anyone help and explain. I absolutely love CoD blackout and would love to see different maps from varying environments/regions. Possibly also a 25 man team vs 4 other groups with tasks to accomplish. Just spitballing but would love to see this blackout expanded Yesterday I switched from RAID to AHCI mode (prep for Linux dual boot next week). Today I noted the odd slowness with folder operations in Windows, eg creating a folder. This got me speculating about the Intel Rapid Storage Technology and Management software. Was it operating in RAID mode? (Does it even work like that? 😀) So I uninstalled it, rebooted and, anecdotally, everything seemed super snappy. I read the info on the Intel Rapid Storage Technology and Management stuff Intel Rapid Storage was bugging me to do something for ages, so I clicked on it and let it do its thing. It deleted my HDD or converted it into a recovery. And i cannot revert this. I did my research on this and found a confirmed solution in the forums but i tried it and it did not work for me. Hre is the link of the solution. https://community.acer.com/en/discussion/552475/hdd-not-showing-in-this-pc-after-accidentally-creating-intel-rapid-storage-technology-please-help/p2 When i tried 
Ok maybe someone can explain this to me cuz I'm still trying to figure it all out. Legacy bios vs UEFI. I know most laptops nowadays especially ones loaded with Win10, are using UEFI. So for those that are still putting Win7 (x64) on these new machines, what do we do cuz I think I've tried it all. Do we keep UEFI on in the bios or turn on legacy boot? One of the problems I'm having is, I have this new precision that I''ve deployed a Windows 7 clone image Intel rapid storage technology driver: Что это такое, для чего нужен и нужно ли его устанавливать. старые контроллеры: %PCI\VEN_8086 DEV_3B29 CC_0106.DeviceDesc% = iaStorA_inst, PCI\VEN_8086 DEV_3B29 CC_0106 %PCI\VEN_8086 DEV_3B2F CC_0106.
